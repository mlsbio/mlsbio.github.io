        "abstract": "To understand how proteins function, we need to know the conformations that they adopt and with what they interact in their native cellular environment. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) offers a powerful tool by enabling \\textit{in situ} imaging of proteins. But high noise levels and the need for expertise in particle identification limit its scalability. In this study, we present a machine learning framework for automated recognition and localization of particles in cryo-ET data. We treat particle picking as an object recognition task and employ a U-Net-based architecture for multi-class segmentation. To overcome the scarcity of annotated data, we train our model on synthetic tomograms generated by a simulator that incorporates empirical noise from publicly available cryo-ET datasets. Our results show that training on a mixed dataset containing both synthetic and empirical backgrounds provides the most effective particle-picking performance, enhancing the model\u2019s robustness to different background types. Furthermore, we demonstrate that training exclusively on simulated particles enables the model to reliably distinguish particles from background in real tomograms, highlighting the potential of simulation-based training strategies in cryo-ET.",

Achieving a balance between different drug-like properties is crucial for the development of viable candidates, and this search becomes exponentially challenging as desired properties grow. The ever-growing zoo of sophisticated in silico tools for predicting antibody properties calls for an efficient joint optimization procedure to overcome resource-intensive sequential filtering pipelines. We present BOAT, a versatile Bayesian optimization framework for multi-property antibody engineering. Our 'plug-and-play' framework couples uncertainty-aware surrogate modeling with a genetic algorithm to jointly optimize various predicted antibody traits while enabling efficient exploration of sequence space. Through systematic benchmarking against genetic algorithms, we demonstrate that our method efficiently explores the Pareto front where the combinatorial ground truth is available.",

This is in part because high-quality annotated data are far more difficult to obtain for proteins than for natural language. We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. <br/>Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM’s output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants.<br/>Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family. The supervised fine-tuned model generates sequences that are not only more novel but also display improved characteristics across both targeted design constraints and emergent protein property measures.",

Furthermore, most TCR-epitope models represent only one of three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the TCR, potentially limiting performance.

However, existing evaluation tools, such as OpenStructure, introduce systematic biases when evaluating models with stoichiometries different from the target, sometimes favoring those with excess subunits and inflating scores for incorrect stoichiometries. To address this issue, we developed the Reciprocal Best Matching (RBM) pipeline. RBM compares predicted and target structures by bidirectionally matching interfaces and assigning penalizations to unmatched interfaces. This approach penalizes incorrect stoichiometries in a consistent and unbiased manner while preserving strong correlation with established CASP metrics. Application of RBM in CASP16 assessments revealed improved discrimination between correctly and incorrectly stoichiometric models.

        "abstract": "Antibodies play crucial roles in immune defense and serve as key therapeutic agents for numerous diseases. The structural and sequence diversity of their antigen recognition loops, coupled with the scarcity of high-quality data, pose significant challenges in the development of generalizable predictive models. Here, we present a sequence specific fine-tuning strategy for antibodies that partially bypass the need for generalization. We evaluated this approach in three biologically relevant tasks: antibody structure prediction, zero-shot prediction of beneficial mutation in antibody-antigen complexes and binding affinity prediction. In all three tasks, we observed substantial improvements over pLM baselines without fine-tuning, while using only a fraction of the computational and time resources required for fully fine-tuning antibody-specific pLMs. We further extended our method to layer-wise selective fine-tuning, with the aim of investigating how model size, fine-tuning duration, and fine-tuning depth collectively influence downstream performance. Fine-tuning 50%-75% of LoRA layers was found to be optimal for small- to medium-sized pLMs, with the initial perplexity of each sequence providing some guidance for determining the best fine-tuning duration. Building on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting beneficial mutations and binding affinity. These results establish our layer-wise selective, sequence specific fine-tuning strategy as an efficient and practical strategy for antibody-related prediction tasks, providing a useful protocol for future applications in immunology.",

        "abstract": "Co-folding models like AlphaFold have revolutionized protein complex structure prediction, yet their reliance on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) limits their applicability on challenging targets such as antibody-antigen complexes. An alternative approach, structure-based protein-protein docking, predicts the complex structure from the unbound monomer structures without requiring MSAs. In this work, we propose a novel method to adapt co-folding models for structure-based docking by replacing their template module with a docking module, followed by training end-to-end with a flow-matching objective. We apply our method to AlphaFold-Multimer (AF-M) using the OpenFold implementation and transform it into a generative docking model, which we name AF2Dock. We evaluate AF2Dock on the PINDER-AF2 benchmark and an antibody/nanobody test set, and demonstrate that AF2Dock consistently performs competitively or outperforms other structure-based docking methods when using non-holo inputs, especially in the case of antibody and nanobody complexes. Although AF2Dock underperforms co-folding AF-M and AF3 in success rates when using non-holo inputs, it produces orthogonal predictions and successfully identifies correct structures for targets where co-folding models fail. Ablation studies confirm that full-parameter fine-tuning of the AF-M components is critical for performance and reveal that, surprisingly, the inclusion of ESM embeddings can hinder success rates in certain cases.

        "abstract": "Modern therapeutic antibody design often involves composing multi-part assemblages of individual functional domains, each of which may be derived from a different source or engineered independently. While these complex formats can expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning framework to predict reformatting success -- whether converting an antibody from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple, domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a new starting antibody. In this challenging \"new antibody, no data\" scenario, our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.

However, systematically modeling how 1D epigenomic features give rise to 3D chromosome ensembles remains an unsolved challenge. Inspired by advances in protein structure prediction and modern generative modeling, we introduce ChromWeave, a symmetry-aware generative framework that couples flow matching with an equivariant neural network to directly generate physically realistic 3D chromosome ensembles from epigenomic signals. By enforcing physical symmetries, ChromWeave achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over traditional physics-based simulations while producing experimentally consistent structural distributions. Trained on single-cell MERFISH chromosome imaging data and raw 1D epigenomic features, ChromWeave learns a continuous-time equivariant velocity field that maps simple prior distributions to realistic conformational distributions, avoiding large-scale pretraining and remaining highly data-efficient. Our results show that ChromWeave accurately captures both polymeric properties of chromosomes and genomic organizational features such as domains and boundaries that closely match MERFISH measurements. Together, ChromWeave provides a computationally efficient and physically grounded approach for mapping 1D epigenomic features to 3D genome ensembles, with the potential to generalize across genomic regions and ultimately scale to whole-genome modeling.",

Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future progress.",

Deep-learning-based approaches for sequence design have proven highly successful for various protein design applications, but many non-idealized backbones still remain out of reach for current models under typical in silico success criteria. We hypothesize that training objectives prioritizing native sequence recovery unintentionally push models to reproduce non-structural signals (e.g. phylogenetic relatedness, neutral drift, or dataset sampling biases), rather than a broadly generalizable structure-sequence mapping. Inspired by recent work bridging sequence likelihood and fitness prediction in protein language models, we introduce Caliby, a Potts model-based sequence design method capable of conditioning on an ensemble of structures. Conditioning on a synthetic ensemble generated from an input backbone allows sampling of sequences consistent with the structural constraints of the ensemble while averaging out undesired biases towards the native sequence. Ensemble-conditioned sequence design with Caliby reduces native sequence recovery while substantially improving AlphaFold2 self-consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art models ProteinMPNN and ChromaDesign on both native and de novo backbones.

Following this reasoning, we present a general computational design protocol to monomerize multimeric enzymes while preserving their active-site geometry. Our method combines Monte Carlo optimization with an energy-based formalism, specifying design constraints as energy terms defined through the outputs of a protein-folding algorithm. Specifically, by driving the sequence search to active-site geometries close to that of the multimeric enzyme, we generate monomeric variants with low RMSD to the multimeric active site, in line with commonly used thresholds to filter potential candidates for lab testing.

SynthFormer features a 3D equivariant graph neural network to encode pharmacophores, followed by a Transformer-based synthesis-aware decoding mechanism for constructing synthetic trees as a sequence of tokens. It is a first-of-its-kind approach that could provide capabilities for designing active molecules based on pharmacophores, performing hit expansion and optimizing their properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness through various challenging tasks, including designing active compounds for a range of proteins, performing hit expansion and optimizing molecular properties.",

Despite advances in deep learning, computational methods have achieved limited success in this area; even the best-reported approaches reach only moderate localization accuracy on high-resolution crystal structures, and even worse when applied to medium-resolution data. We hypothesize that the main challenge lies in the nature of metal binding: while the putative sites span the entire protein surface, actual binding requires the atomic-level coordination geometry. We present a structure-based metal binding site and type predictor, PrOMet, in this work, which leverages a Prune-and-Optimization strategy built upon two hierarchically connected machine learning architectures. This strategy allows the method to effectively narrow the search space while maintaining robustness to AlphaFold models and medium-resolution cryo-EM structures.

All autoregressive models demonstrated substantially lower contact recovery compared to the masked langauge model ESM2 (model with the best performance: ProGen3 P@L=0.077 vs ESM2=0.450). While scaling improved contact detection, even the largest model, ProGen3 46B, performed better than random in only 31 out of 105 proteins. We hypothesize that autoregressive models primarily learn dependencies between sequence fragments rather than residue-level coevolution, with fragments shorten as models scale. This limitation may explain why current autoregressive models often require generating millions of sequences followed by extensive post hoc filtering to obtain viable designs and why their generations have high sequence identity to the natural proteins, limiting their degree of novelty.

However, the design of precise placements at atomic scales remains a challenge for existing design methods. One avenue towards higher fidelity atomic-scale design is via generative models with full atomic resolution, but is complicated by the intricacies of simultaneously designing both discrete protein sequence and continuous atomic positionings. In this work we propose a framework to capture this interplay by decomposing residues into collections of oriented rigid bodies, allowing us to apply SE(3) flow-matching for all-atom protein structure generation. Our method, ProteinZen, generates designs with high sequence-structure consistency while retaining competitive diversity and novelty on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks. We demonstrate competitive performance for unconditional monomer design and state-of-the-art performance on various forms of motif scaffolding, including full-atom motif scaffolding and motif scaffolding without specifying motif segment spacing or relative sequence order.",

        "authors": "Karson Chrispens, Henry van den Bedem, Stephanie Wankowicz, James Fraser",
        "abstract": "Proteins explore the conformational space around their native state to accomplish their function, so modeling the ensemble of accessible conformations is essential for understanding their behavior. Current structural models derived from macromolecular X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy deposited in the Protein Data Bank are largely deposited as single states that fail to recognize the ensemble nature of proteins in experiments. Structure prediction models are trained on these single state structures, discarding cases where alternative conformations were manually built by an experimental modeler. Here, we apply steering of the Boltz-2 structure prediction model with synthetic density maps from manually modeled alternative conformations to explore the limitations of existing structure predictors. We find that sampling of alternative conformations is biased towards the single state structures in the training set despite the physical plausibility of the modeled alternative conformations, indicating limited ability to generalize in conformational space. To address this, we identify opportunities to overcome these limitations through augmenting training with alternative conformations and evaluating with experimental data.",

        "abstract": "Predicting labels in massive, hierarchically structured output spaces is a core challenge in machine learning. In this work, we use the problem of predicting the full taxonomic lineage of a protein from its sequence as a case study for this challenge. We introduce TaxoFormer, an architecture whose primary contribution is a structured tokenization scheme that losslessly represents the entire NCBI phylogenetic tree\u2014a graph with over 1.3 million nodes\u2014using a compact vocabulary of just 15,000 tokens. By coupling a pre-trained ESM-2 model with an autoregressive decoder and training with a standard cross-entropy objective, we test the hypothesis that a simple generative objective is sufficient to learn complex, latent structure when the output space is explicitly modeled. We show that this approach is highly effective: on a dataset of 188 million proteins, the model not only achieves accurate lineage prediction but also implicitly learns a continuous, phylogenetically-structured latent space. This work provides a scalable, alignment-free method for taxonomic annotation and demonstrates that explicitly modeling the structure of a complex output space is a powerful mechanism for learning meaningful representations.",

        "abstract": "Missense variation in the nuclear pore complex (NPC) remains difficult to interpret because sequence change, structural context, and sparse clinical labels all interact in nontrivial ways. We study three functionally distinct nucleoporins GLE1, NUP214, and NUP62 and build a reproducible pipeline that binds variants to canonical UniProt coordinates, overlays AlphaFold2 per-residue confidence, and assigns domain/feature labels from UniProtKB/Pfam. Primary inferences rely strictly on curated ClinVar assertions, while a separate high-confidence pseudo-labeled cohort is created for sensitivity analyses using a guarded weak-supervision scheme: a centroid-cosine scorer over handcrafted sequence-structural features is ensembled with a positive-unlabeled classifier, and only variants passing conservative probability gates are promoted. Across genes, curated data reveal coherent structure-function signals: pathogenic substitutions concentrate in specific domains and structurally ordered regions, while the pseudo-labeled cohort preserves these trends under expanded sample size without entering into hypothesis tests. The result is a transparent workflow that cleanly separates ground truth from weak supervision, avoids leakage, and produces interpretable, domain-level effect estimates. We argue that this combination of principled labeling, structural context, and simple, auditable models offers a practical path for variant interpretation in nucleoporins and, more broadly, in proteins rich in intrinsically disordered and repeat-containing regions.",

From a steric perspective, this problem is exacerbated by the intrinsic flexibility of proteins, which can hide variations in shape that could be exploited for selective design.  To address this problem, we propose FlexVASP-S, the first interpretable 3D geometic learning framework that identifies regions of hindrance in binding cavities that select for different ligands.  FlexVASP-S identifies these regions despite noisy conformational variations by using flexible structural representations and explainable AI techniques.  We tested FlexVASP-S on two superfamilies of proteins that have subfamilies with different ligand preferences, producing conformational variations of every protein with molecular dynamics simulations.  Even though substantial motion occurs, FlexVASP-S identified regions that accommodate ligands preferred by one subfamily and not by others, recapitulating established experimental findings.  It also accurately classified cavities with similar binding preferences. The code is publicly shared at \\url{https://github.com/LehighInfolab/FlexVASP-S}.",

To ensure structural plausibility of synthetic training samples, we develop \\textbf{NanoKink}, the first sequence-based classifier of kinked versus extended H-CDR3 conformations, and apply stringent filtering criteria for non-canonical disulfide bond placement and conformational accuracy. On a curated benchmark enriched for challenging nanobody features, we show that, for a fixed training compute budget, a nanobody-specific model trained with filtered synthetic data significantly improves over baseline models and NanobodyBuilder2, achieving lower mean H-CDR3 RMSD and fewer structural violations, while remaining competitive with AlphaFold3 at approximately two orders of magnitude lower per-structure inference time. Our results highlight promising directions in synthetic data generation for nanobody structure modelling and provide a practical framework for optimisation of VHH structure prediction models.",

Yet, most widely used methods focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles \u03d5and \u03c8, and show that the selected features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that explain variation in these angles.",

Supervised learning approaches have shown promise in glycan modeling; however, the current literature is fragmented regarding datasets and standardized evaluation techniques, hampering progress in understanding these complex, branched carbohydrates, which play crucial roles in biological processes. To facilitate progress, we introduce GlycoGym, a comprehensive benchmark suite containing six biologically relevant supervised learning tasks spanning different domains of glycobiology: glycosylation linkage identification, tissue expression prediction, taxonomy classification, tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation prediction, lectin-glycan interaction modeling, and structural property estimation. We curate tasks into specific training, validation, and test splits using multi-class stratification to ensure that each task tests biologically relevant generalization that transfers to real-life glycan property prediction scenarios. We benchmark a diverse range of approaches to glycan representation learning, spanning fingerprint-based baselines, language models operating on IUPAC-condensed sequences, and graph neural networks explicitly designed for glycan topology, including SweetNet, GLAMOUR, and the recent GIFFLAR architecture. We find that specialized glycan encoders consistently outperform simple baselines for the more complex tasks. GlycoGym will help the machine learning community to focus their efforts on scientifically relevant glycan prediction problems and will be regularly updated through the GlycoGym Python package and on Zenodo.

We propose Curriculum\u2011Augmented GFlowNets (CAGFN), which integrate curriculum learning with multi\u2011objective GFlowNets to generate de novo mRNA sequences. CAGFN integrates a length\u2011based curriculum that progressively adapts the maximum sequence length guiding exploration from easier to harder subproblems.  We also provide a new mRNA design environment for GFlowNets which, given a target protein sequence and a combination of biological objectives, generates plausible mRNA candidates encoding the same protein. This provides a biologically motivated setting for applying and advancing GFlowNets in mRNA sequence design. On different mRNA tasks, CAGFN improves Pareto performance and biological plausibility, while maintaining sequence diversity. Moreover, CAGFN reaches higher-quality solutions faster than a GFlowNet trained with random sequence sampling (no curriculum), and enables generalization to out-of-distribution sequences.",

We introduce a framework for non-differentiable guidance of protein generative models, coupling a continuous diffusion-based generator with any black-box objective via a tailored genetic algorithm.  We demonstrate its effectiveness across three modalities: pairwise distance constraints, nuclear Overhauser effect restraints, and for the first time chemical shifts.
