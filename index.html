                    <p class="lead">
                    In only a few years, structural biology, the study of the 3D structure or shape of proteins and
                    other biomolecules, has been transformed by breakthroughs from machine learning algorithms.
                    Machine learning models are now routinely being used by experimentalists to predict structures
                    that can help answer real biological questions (e.g. AlphaFold), accelerate the experimental
                    process of structure determination (e.g. computer vision algorithms for cryo-electron
                    microscopy), and have become a new industry standard for bioengineering new protein
                    therapeutics (e.g. large language models for protein design). Despite all this progress, there are
                    still many active and open challenges for the field, such as modeling protein dynamics,
                    predicting higher order complexes, pushing towards generalization of protein folding physics,
                    and relating the structure of proteins to the in vivo and contextual nature of their underlying
                    function. These challenges are diverse and interdisciplinary, motivating new kinds of machine
                    learning systems and requiring the development and maturation of standard benchmarks and
                    datasets.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                    In this exciting time for the field, our workshop, “Machine Learning in Structural Biology” (MLSB),
                    seeks to bring together relevant experts, practitioners, and students across a broad community
                    to focus on these challenges and opportunities. We believe the union of these communities, including the
                    geometric and graph learning communities, NLP researchers, and structural biologists with
                    domain expertise at our workshop can help spur
                    new ideas, spark collaborations, and advance the impact of machine learning in structural
                    biology. Progress at this intersection promises to unlock new scientific discoveries and the ability
                    to design novel medicines.

			  <p>Jane S. Richardson and her husband David have worked together for over 50 years on
				  research to understand the 3D structure of protein and RNA molecules, including their description, determinants,
				  folding, evolution, and control.  They were among the early groups doing protein crystallography, helped to
				  start the field of protein de novo design, and developed the molecular graphics system of "kinemages".
				  Around 2000 they developed a method that calculates hydrogen-atom contacts to visualize and quantify the
				  details of packing interactions inside and between molecules.  Its principal application is to improving
				  the accuracy of experimental structures of protein and RNA molecules, as implemented on their MolProbity
				  structure-validation web service and within the Phenix software system for crystallography & cryoEM, and
				  used to help depositors re-version early-release SARS-COV-2 structures.  They are now working on validation
				  methods that can still find errors when previous validation criteria are being refined or restrained.</p>
			  <p>Prof. Richardson pioneered ribbon drawings for representing protein structures, first
				  described many of the common features of overall protein folds and their local motifs (such as Greek key beta
				  barrels, righthanded crossovers, helix caps, cis Pro touch-turns, vicinal disulfides) and has worked to spread
				  molecular 3D literacy to students and colleagues at Duke and around the world.  From a Swarthmore B.A. in math,
				  physics, astronomy and philosophy, she has become a biophysicist, a MacArthur Fellow, a member of the National
				  Academies of Sciences & of Medicine, and a James B. Duke Professor of Biochemistry at Duke, and has three honorary
				  degrees to fill in for her lack of a PhD.  For more details, see Ann. Rev. Biophysics (2013) 4:1-28 or J. Biol.

Regina Barzilay is a Delta Electronics Professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a faculty lead for the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health (J-Clinic). She is also a principal investigator at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Barzilay’s research interests are in natural language processing, and applications of deep learning to chemistry and oncology. Her research focuses on developing deep learning models that can transfer annotations across domains and languages, that can learn from a few annotated examples by utilizing supplementary data sources, and that can take advantage of human-provided rationales to constrain model structure. Barzilay has received an NSF Career Award, MIT Technology Review’s TR-35 Award, and Microsoft Faculty Fellowship. She has also received fellowships from the MacArthur Foundation, Association for Computational Linguistics and Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. She received a PhD in computer science from Columbia University, and was a postdoc at Cornell University.
